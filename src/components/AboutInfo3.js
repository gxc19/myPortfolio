                <p>Code Nation</p>
                <p>throughout the years, the career path I wanted always changed over time. From wanting to become an architecture, to mechanical engineer, and then an accountant. Never in a million years would I have thought I would chose to become a software developer.</p>
                <p>I was first introduced to Code Nation when my friend John mentioned about them during my time in lower sixth. It definitely sounded promising, but wasn't enough to fully persuade me. It was only until I finished upper sixth, I came to a conclusion that university wasn't for me. For the time being, I was just staying at home looking for an opportunity for an apprenticeship. It was only when John messaged me about going to the open evening for Code Nation Chester. This is where I met Dan, Ben and Ian who did a great talk about what Code Nation is all about. At this point I was intrigued and ended up joining the 3 week develop course.</p>
                <p>I had a lot of fun during the develop course, and even though it was only 3 weeks I definitely felt I've learnt a lot. After finishing the develop course, it was time to kick it up a notch and apply for the 12 week master course. This is where i currently stand, on the 8th week. There have definitely been a lot of head scratching moments but that is all apart of learning something new. It's been quite the journey but once I finish the master course, I only hope to continue to further expand my knowledge and experience when working in the industry.</p>

                <p>Hobbies</p>
                <p>In my spare time, other than chilling at home and spending time with my family, I like to be a little creative. When I was younger I loved to draw. The things I drew varied depending on my current interest at the time.</p>
                <p>Gradually, I began to like being more hands on which had led me to discover origami and DIY (do it yourself). The main materials I use are paper and cardboard due to how easily accessible they are. I enjoy the planning aspect because there are many different ways of going about making something. Currently, I'm working on a katana from an anime series called Demon Slayer.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I like to watch and read anime and manga. From a design aspect I can really appreciate the different designs the author has given to each characters.</p>

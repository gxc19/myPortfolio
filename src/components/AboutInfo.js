                <p>My name is Ga Ming Chan.</p>
                <p>I used to be a rather shy guy, but over time I feel like i've opened up a lot more after taking some drama lessons back in school. This has helped me be more confident when speaking up.</p>
                <p>In regards to education, I studied at Abbey Gate College and stayed until upper sixth. I studied Business Studies, Design & Technology and EPQ.</p>
